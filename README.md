# nss-cohort-13-directory-init

Copy the projectinit.sh to the dir you want to create and run 
$ chmod 755

This makes the script executable.

To use, type ./projectinit.sh

Right now the file has to be run from within the user's directory but I would like to put it in place that is in the user's 
$PATH. Also, the script has the location where the projectstarter directory should be located (~/projectstarter) hardcoded.
This needs to be changed to a variable that can be changed in one place to suit the student's needs.
